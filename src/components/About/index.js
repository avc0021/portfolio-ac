        Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a background in biotechnology and music to build life-enhancing user experiences on mobile and web applications. 
        Recently earned a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from The University of Texas at San Antonio, with newly developed skills using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, 
        CSS, Node.js, HTML, MySQL, Heroku, GitHub/Bash, object-oriented programming, and responsive web design. While working with a team of four on a recent project, we created a MERN stack application
